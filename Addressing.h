 * address math for the NEC 78K/III core.
 *
 * This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for these address<->byte transforms,
 * shared by both the disassembler (decode: byte -> address, for display)
 * and the vasm cpu backend (encode: address -> byte, for assembly). A
 * correction made here applies to both tools the next time they're
 * rebuilt, so "what the disassembler shows" and "what the assembler
 * would produce" can't silently drift apart.
 *
 * All addresses are plain 16-bit CPU addresses (e.g. 0xFE20-0xFF1FH for
 * saddr, 0xFF00-0xFFFFH for sfr). All byte values are the raw 8-bit
 * offset field taken directly out of the instruction encoding.
